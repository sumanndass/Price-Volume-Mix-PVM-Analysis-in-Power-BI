# 📊 Price–Volume–Mix (PVM) Analysis in Power BI
## Revenue Change Explained | Growth Quality | Strategic Risk & Opportunity
Mix Analysis explains why revenue changed between two periods by splitting the change into three clear drivers: 1️⃣ Price Effect, 2️⃣ Volume Effect, 3️⃣ Mix Effect.

## 🔍 What This Project Solves
- Most revenue dashboards answer **“what changed”**.
- Executives actually ask **“why did it change, is it good, and where should we act?”**
  <br>
- This Power BI model answers:
  - Why did revenue grow or decline?
  - Was growth driven by **real demand** or **pricing actions**?
  - Did **product mix create value or silently dilute it**?
  - Which **region–customer–product** actually moved the needle?
  - Where is growth **strategically risky vs sustainable**?
- This is achieved through a fully decomposed Price–Volume–Mix framework, implemented in DAX and visualized across 3 analytical layers.
